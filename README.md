# Functional Programming Labs
This repository is a collection of tasks worked on during the Winter Term 2018 at TUHH.

In the individual folders you can find our source code as well as the accompanying task sheets.
Notice that our implementation is not complete. Especially non-mandatory tasks were not adding during some sessions.
